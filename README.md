A.W.I.T Core
================================

I present a new technology to simplify web development and website display.


GREETINGS!
-------------------------

One of the main problems has always been buggy or slow loading site.
Since the browser loads the content, images, menus, scripts, styles, and at the same time.
And it so happens that the user to see the content needed to wait for the full site load, and when a slow connection is not very convenient.

The first thing that makes core optimizes loading site and accelerates it.
If you write a template specifically for AWIT Core, it is possible is achieved in 50% loading rate.
Built-in security, remove from the page unwanted scripts and iframe.

Even at speeds of up to 100 kb / s poster will be displayed faster and more stable.
Future versions will work better with the code and uploading sites.
For best results, better to write template is built on AWITCore.

In the future I will write more.

-------------------------
- General scripts for page
- Site load acceleration
